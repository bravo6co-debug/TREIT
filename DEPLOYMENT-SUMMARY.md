# TreitMaster Database Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status: PREPARED (Manual Execution Required)

Since direct database connections to Supabase are restricted and the anon API key lacks DDL permissions, the schema has been prepared for manual deployment through the Supabase dashboard.

## What Was Prepared

### 1. Complete Schema Analysis
- ✅ Analyzed `database-schema-complete.sql` (24,464 characters)
- ✅ Identified 23+ ENUM types
- ✅ Identified 15+ core tables with relationships
- ✅ Located 50 level configurations (Bronze to Platinum)
- ✅ Found Row Level Security policies and indexes

### 2. Deployment Chunks Created
The schema was split into 7 manageable chunks for deployment:

| File | Content | Size |
|------|---------|------|
| `chunk-1-extensions-enums.sql` | Extensions and all ENUM types | ~2KB |
| `chunk-2-core-tables.sql` | Users, Businesses, Campaigns tables | ~5KB |
| `chunk-3-remaining-tables.sql` | Templates, User Campaigns, Click Events, etc. | ~4KB |
| `chunk-4-additional-tables.sql` | Transactions, Fraud Detection, Social Accounts | ~4KB |
| `chunk-5-indexes-rls.sql` | All indexes and Row Level Security policies | ~3KB |
| `chunk-6-functions-data.sql` | Functions, triggers, and Bronze/Silver levels | ~2KB |
| `chunk-7-level-data.sql` | Gold, Diamond, and Platinum level data | ~2KB |

### 3. Deployment Tools Created
- ✅ `deployment-guide.md` - Comprehensive deployment instructions
- ✅ `verify-deployment.sql` - Post-deployment verification script
- ✅ `deploy-schema.py` - Python deployment script (blocked by network)
- ✅ `deploy-schema.js` - Node.js deployment script (lacks permissions)

## Database Schema Components

### Core Tables (15 total)
- `users` - User accounts with XP/level system
- `businesses` - Business accounts and verification
- `campaigns` - Marketing campaigns with budget tracking
- `templates` - Campaign content templates
- `user_campaigns` - User-campaign matching
- `click_events` - Click tracking and fraud detection
- `user_earnings` - User earnings history
- `user_transactions` - Balance and withdrawal tracking
- `business_billing` - Business billing and payments
- `fraud_detections` - Fraud detection logs
- `user_social_accounts` - Connected social platforms
- `daily_bonuses` - Daily bonus system
- `referrals` - Referral tracking
- `level_config` - Level/grade configuration (50 levels)
- `queue_messages` - Async processing queue

### ENUM Types (23 total)
- User system: `user_status`, `user_grade`, `social_platform`
- Business: `business_status`, `business_industry`, `company_size`
- Campaigns: `campaign_category`, `approval_status`, `matching_status`
- Transactions: `transaction_type`, `transaction_category`, `transaction_status`
- Payments: `payment_provider`, `payout_method`, `billing_cycle`
- Fraud: `fraud_type`, `fraud_action`, `review_decision`
- System: `device_type`, `reward_type`, `admin_role`, `template_type`

### Level System
- 50 levels across 5 grades (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Platinum)
- Progressive XP requirements (0 to 68,600 XP)
- CPC bonus percentages (0% to 90%)
- Daily bonus amounts (50 to 2000)
- Korean grade and level titles

## Deployment Instructions

### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qbdctgumggdtfewttela
2. Navigate to "SQL Editor"
3. Execute each chunk file in order (1 through 7)
4. Run `verify-deployment.sql` to confirm success

### Method 2: Alternative Tools
- Supabase CLI (if available): `supabase db push`
- Direct PostgreSQL connection (if credentials available)

## Verification

To verify deployment, execute the verification script which checks:
- ✅ All 15+ tables created
- ✅ All 23+ ENUM types created
- ✅ All 50 level configurations inserted
- ✅ Indexes and RLS policies applied
- ✅ Functions and triggers created

Expected final count:
- Tables: 15+
- ENUMs: 23+
- Level configurations: 50 (levels 1-50)
- Indexes: 20+
- RLS policies: 10+

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Schema**: Execute chunks 1-7 in the Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Verify Deployment**: Run the verification script
3. **Test Basic Operations**: Insert/query test data
4. **Configure Application**: Update connection strings and settings

## Note on Security

The schema includes comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
- Users can only access their own data
- Businesses can only manage their campaigns
- Service role has full access for admin operations
- Public access only to approved, active campaigns

The deployment is ready to proceed manually through the Supabase dashboard.
